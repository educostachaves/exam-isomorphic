## About The Project

The project aim is to create the new **ENEM Exam Simulator Platform** at Descomplica.
The things we considered on this project are:

- A fast and easy to use framework that can be used by both BackEnd and FrontEnd developers.
- A modern, simple, declarative and composable Javascript library.
- The Ability to share client and server javascript code.
- Built on top of open source technologies.
- Built using our new api infrastructure.
- Easy to deploy
- Easy to start developing

Given those prerequisites, we chose to built this application with:

- Node.js provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API that optimizes an application's throughput and scalability.
- React.JS provides the modern, simple, declarative, composable and isomorphic requirements.
